Search for organizations available to help by entering key words. 

Find local soup kitchens and food pantries.

We'll offer assistance in submitting applications for services and tracking follow up to eliminate the risk of people falling through the cracks:
Homeless shelters
Housing assistance
Employment assistance and job training
Our site will include criteria required to receive services from each organization so you save time, rather than applying with organizations for which you don't qualify. This also saves time from them having to review and deny your application. 

Once services are received (problems are solved), we will contact any organizations whose waiting lists clients are on, to let them know to remove that client from their list and move on to the next person on their waiting list. This will allow the wait time to shrink on the waiting lists, providing more help to more people in a shorter period of time. Organizations can make a bigger difference in the world by making the difference they want in more people's lives. 

You'll be able to designate what your donations go towards. You want to make a donation to the services or people whose stories resonate with you. 

We'll have client profiles that reveal their story, their dreams, their skills and talents. Some may offer names of people who have made a difference in their lives, like family or friends. Maybe you can help them reconnect with someone they haven't been able to locate. Of course, any information will only be revealed with expressed, written permission. 

You may choose to sponsor a particular client, whether anonymously or not. 

You may want to help someone but you don't want to give them money directly. You can help by encouraging them to become our client. We'll have or find resources that can help......and your donation is now tax deductible so you can afford to donate more. Your money is going where you want it to go. You're changing someone's life.....not to mention your life changes knowing you're making a difference.  

Our staff will be trained to work with clients to help them get [back] on their feet and learn how to take control of their lives. Teaching them life skills and offering support.

We are hard at work to bring this vision to life. Our goal is to change the world by changing lives. You can help today by making a donation so we can afford the help we need to get this up and running, and sharing our vision with others who can help. 

Soon enough we'll be asking you to share with those who NEED help. 

Make a difference TODAY! </pre>
